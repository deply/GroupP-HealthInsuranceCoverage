#### Abstract: We are interested in finding out how health insurance coverage in the USA differs from state to state, its relationship to indicators of health performance, and whether it can be predicted by political factors. We will explore the following questions:


1. How does insurance coverage differ from state to state? We can also ask more detailed questions such as on employer-provided insurance coverage and coverage of different age groups.

2. How has the rate of insurance coverage changed over time over the last decade? In which states did insurance coverage expand under Obamacare? Which states observed the greatest decline in their uninsured rate?

3. How does health insurance coverage relate to regional variations in health outcomes? We can look at indicators of mortality and rates of major diseases, plotting these on a map as well. (Also find ways to control for income differences and other factors.)

4. How does healthcare access differ by state? How does health insurance coverage relate to participation / uptake in preventative measures and treatment options (such as vaccinations, mammograms)?

5. How do the sentiments towards Obamacare differ from state to state, and how does it relate to voting patterns? If feasible, we plan to analyze sentiments from twitter data, whether Obamacare is mentioned alongside positive or negative words.

We will make use of ggplot2, spatial data techniques, and text mining techniques in our visualization project.
